  <h1>Hey there 9th grade! </h1>
<p>

&emsp;&emsp;We've put together this publication to showcase some awesome work from Ms. Bueckert-Chan’s students.  We've all worked so hard this year to put forth our best and we've continued to do so throughout quarantine as well. We hope you can use this opportunity to embrace your work through the beauty of writing and know that your work is unique to you and only you-it’s yours to remember! Thank you to everyone who contributed and cooperated to make this possible and thank you to everyone for staying strong during these difficult times in life full of social distancing, and painful truths revealed about police brutality, hate and racism in our city and country.  
	</p>
	<p>
&emsp;&emsp;We know that it can be hard to write, think, and especially brainstorm in a time where the world has gone dark and we’re all suffering in different ways and/or know someone who is as well. We hope to overcome these challenges together and to one day be learning in the same room again.  Browse through the site to view the work and art of your classmates. Enjoy!
