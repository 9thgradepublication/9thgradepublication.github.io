* I was once isolated on a jam-packed planet
* Even with gravity, I was still floating
* Nothing could hold me down
* Adrift and lost in my own soul,
* on a planet full of masked identities

* Then I encountered you

* The mismatched clothing, unpolished sound of your voice
* was nothing I’ve ever come across before
* Cluttered, clumsy and sort of unruly
* Like a weird concoction

* I should’ve noticed sooner
* that there was more than what meets the eye
* My soul reflected right back at me
* I found a mentality similar to mine,
* sophisticated, yet simple, and ordinary, although unique

* Every moment we spend is another chapter,
* yet our story is still unfinished
* I knew to you I could always confide
* Gravity once defied me
* But you’ve helped retrieve me
*  
*  
*  
*  
* 
* And now I’m standing
* However, it’s on a planet of our own this time
