* This emotion rising within,
* When I hear her name,
* Old memories rushing in,
* Although it will never be the same.

* A memory rises,
* Of us when we were little,
* Running around the house,
* Dancing and singing,
* Until we were exhausted.

* A memory rises,
* Of us when we were little,
* Me braiding her silky black hair,
* And doing crazy hairstyles,
* Until her hair got all tangled up.

* A memory rises,
* Of us growing,
* Reading books upon books,
* Sharing magical stories,
* Until the sun had set.

* A memory rises,
* Of us growing,
* Racing to the park,
* And swinging on the swings,
* Until our legs got tired.

* A memory rises,
* Of us when we got older,
* Whispering in a corner,
* Sharing secrets,
* Until our throats got scratchy.

* A memory rises,
* Of us when we got older,
* Laughing and laughing,
* When we went to go watch a movie together,
* Until our stomachs hurt.

* A memory rises,
* Of her leaving,
* Packing her bags,
* And driving away,
* Until all I had left were memories.
