This emotion rising within,

When I hear her name,

Old memories rushing in,

Although it will never be the same.

A memory rises,

Of us when we were little,

Running around the house,

Dancing and singing,

Until we were exhausted.

A memory rises,

Of us when we were little,

Me braiding her silky black hair,

And doing crazy hairstyles,

Until her hair got all tangled up.

A memory rises,

Of us growing,

Reading books upon books,

Sharing magical stories,

Until the sun had set.

A memory rises,

Of us growing,

Racing to the park,

And swinging on the swings,

Until our legs got tired.

A memory rises,

Of us when we got older,

Whispering in a corner,

Sharing secrets,

Until our throats got scratchy.

A memory rises,

Of us when we got older,

Laughing and laughing,

When we went to go watch a movie together,

Until our stomachs hurt.

A memory rises,

Of her leaving,

Packing her bags,

And driving away,

Until all I had left were memories.
