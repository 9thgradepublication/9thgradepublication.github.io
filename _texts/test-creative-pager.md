# YOLO  

  A

Leah Badawi

        It’s been five years since I saw her face. Five years since I saw the ends of her lips widen in a crooked smile, since I could fathom the faintest flicker of hope in her soft brown eyes. Ever since I left her, it's been quiet. Her voice has almost faded from my memory, and I’m left with nothing but fragments of past moments lurking at the back of my mind. Everything seems so cold, perhaps as if after my departure, the once warm, fluttering feeling of privilege in my chest has become but a heap of ash, replaced by a thick blanket of nothingness.

       It’s quiet. So quiet. The whole thought of silence makes me want to do horrible things just to free myself from this prison of rock I call home. Why do I feel so sad here? This is where I met her, back when the dusty emptiness in her eyes were endless pools of stars, bright and ever-growing. It was different back then. Perhaps these memories have aged, collecting dust in the recedes of my brain only to resurface ever so often and bring back the truth I have been dreading for far too long. This feeling is pungent, and whenever it happens it’s almost as if my entire field of view shatters amid a backdrop of red and I’m left to rot in the stark, black cold of my soul.

         The thought makes me flinch and I instinctively reach for her, for her warmth. Yet I am only given the freedom of air, of nothing. What was I thinking? For a second, I could almost smell her hair against my face, the coarse scent of cinnamon overcoming every inch of my body until I am left trembling in hope of more. I let out a sigh and reassure myself of one thing, one thing I have been trying to accept for nearly half a decade.

       She’s not coming back.
