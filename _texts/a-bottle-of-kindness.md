    	Hand sanitizer has been all the rage during these crazy times as we live through a pandemic. As I walk through the streets and look through my phone, I start to feel this greater sense of impending panic and obsession. All over social media, there are stories of drastic increases in prices of sanitizer as well as tales of irrational customers duking it out in the Walmart aisles for a mere morsel of this alcoholic cleaning agent. The thought of it sounds funny at first, but when I think about what kind of fear led them to get physical like this, it becomes scary.

    	Scrolling down her Facebook feed, my mother shows me a number of these questionable news headlines, such as the kids struck with suspension after engaging in a ring of sanitizer dealers, charging their poor classmates fifty cents a dollop. Though she chuckled at that one, I was more concerned about how much money they could have lost. Or that of the money-greedy men stockpiling mountains of these items for a costly resale, much to the chagrin of other consumers. That also includes my mother, who spent an hour scouring the store shelves for sanitizer but came away empty-handed.

    	With this whirling cesspool of gossip and rumors, it’s easy for anyone to fall into the trap of thinking that reality does indeed look like humanity’s worst which plagues the front page of Reddit, Instagram, and other apps.

    	However, when I think about hand sanitizer, rather than this, my mind wanders to a simple but powerful moment I encountered in the school cafeteria. It was the Friday preceding remote learning procedures, so with every step and glance at the unfilled tables around, I was reminded of the unusual emptiness of the large room. It was a slow and cautious school day that dragged on with the same lethargy as a sweat-drenched runner as they circled their last lap on the track gym.

    	Fetching my food, I navigated to the low table inhabited by two idle friends. I sat next to one distracted by her phone and stared down at my untouched and unappetizing tray and my unwashed hands. With the safety measures displayed across the city, eating with unwashed hands was obviously one of those health hazards. But the only source of cleanser for me at the moment was the broken water faucets of the seventh-floor bathroom. The seeming drowsiness of the day was infectious, and I was hit with a dose of laziness that discouraged me from getting up to walk there. Conflicted, I lay there gazing at the door that led to the outside while wondering how nice it would be if I had my very own hand sanitizer to use, from the convenience of my backpack.

    	As soon as I built up the motivation to move, my friend Karen whipped out a wonderful, fruity-scented, yet inedible, mystery bottle. It was as if she read my mind. I met eyes with my other acquaintance, now looking up from her phone, then we looked back at Karen. I asked her where she managed to find this seemingly elusive product.

    	“I don’t know… My mom just gave it to me.”

    	Immediately, I was filled with respect for this individual and her impossibly capable mother. But I continued in silence to turn to the door. How was I to ask her to hand over what is such an expense these days? I could just spend my recommended twenty seconds at the bathroom sink just like any other sanitizer-less student.

    	I took my first step when she benevolently offered, “Do you want some?” I had no words; I could only reach out my hand for a drop of that sweet substance. From that day onward, I held onto my appreciation for that small gift, because in a world where people are reluctant to give their neighbors the mercy of sharing some toilet paper, I could still find a small bottle of kindness.
