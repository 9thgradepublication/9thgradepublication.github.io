* For six years, she grew up -
* Grew up
* tugged between parents
* Grew up
* surrounded by different men,
* which one does she call D-A-D?
* Grew up, with no siblings
* Always given a screen to gaze at
* no attention to a book. a page. a word.
* The age of six, unfamiliar
* with how to spell C-A-T
* unfamiliar with how to spell M-O-T-H-E-R
* only able to proudly spell her name

## **what is that word?**

* Unable to read
* Unable to comprehend letters she’s seeing on the page and
* make out words from them.
* L-O-G-I-C-A-L-L-Y **_talented_**,
* M-O-R-A-L-L-Y **_gifted_**,
* P-H-Y-S-I-C-A-L-L-Y **_skilled_**..
* yet
* **LITERARILY LIMITED**
* So what would you label that?
* Illiterate? Dyslexic? Or simply just -
* Behind?
* And why is she labeled that?
* Must she
* be labeled by the effect of the actions,
* of the people who brought her into this already wretched world.
* This already wretched world:
* filled with kids, ready to laugh at her
* filled with others, ready to compare
* filled with one too many people ready to judge

## **Can you help me spell this?**

* A confused look plastered on her face,
* a face I see all too often
* So, when you hear “_Loreal_,” you may think of your favorite French personal care company L’Oréal
* Yet, I think of a smart girl, put back
* by her own parents’ hands.
