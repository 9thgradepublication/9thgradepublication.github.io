* I vaguely recall
* The unfolding curls in your hair
* Darkening with each sculpted strand
* As you waved from the street
* A braided lock, appearing slightly lighter than the others
* In the dying hours of dusk

* I dimly relive
* The rippling waves of hair
* Spooling gracefully around you
* As you curled in a corner
* A curtain hiding mysteries, fueling fleeting curiosity
* In the reborn hours of dawn

* Yet now

* The sharply chopped edges
* Softly graze your shoulder blades
* Every end
* Of each strand
* Frame you in a portrait unrecognizable

* Looking straight at your anxious eyes
* Eyes once covered shyly
* Now covered just partially
* I whisper,
* Just as anxiously
* {:.indent-6}“What happened?”
