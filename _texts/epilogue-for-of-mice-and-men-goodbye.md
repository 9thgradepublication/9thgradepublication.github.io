The old, rectangular bunkhouse stood unbothered on the hard ground under the large gray clouds gathering up above it. The door, crooked with time, allowed wind gushing little by little, until the door creaked open, and that’s when a man slammed it shut. Through the windows, an old man lay motionless on a bed. Three men gathered around the big square table at the center of the room; in their hands were what appeared to be playing cards. A lizard skidded across the floor as another one peeked out of a bush. The first one ran and ran; the second one chased and chased, never seeming to catch up with it. The leaves on the surrounding trees rustled with noise. Even the little bushes made crisp sounds as the lizards entered and exited through them.
    
    	Two men walked on the rocky path to the wooden door. One of them carrying the other around the shoulders. Slim stumbled as George gave up his weight on him. His lips, red as blood, mumbled something that shuffled with the loud wind. Slim sighed and looked at the 3-yards length still in front of them.
    
    	Slim kicked open the door with his right leg. Candy and the other men looked up at them two. The smell of alcohol immediately filled the small room.
    
    	“Oh hell he stinks,” Carlson spoke up first to break the silence.
    
    	“Got drunk. Tried to stop ‘im. Couldn’t. Jus’ kept on drinking,” Slim responded.
    
    	Life on the farm went about as usual, though it was much quieter now. The summer transitioned into autumn. Leaves turned yellow, brown, and red. One by one, following one another, the leaves fell. Each one sounded loudly as the men walked over them with each footstep. Like how he would before, George got his salary of fifty bucks at the end of each month. Days repeated over and over again. Without warning, snow fell early December. Quietly, George stepped into the snow. He knew Lennie would’ve loved it.
    
    	“That time of the year is here. Boss gonna bring a gallon of whiskey and says, 'Drink hearty, boys. Christmas comes but once a year,’ eh?” George turned his head to Candy.
    
    	“Hell yeah!” Candy yelled back.
    
    	“Aha, another fun night. Been waitin’ for this since forever,” Whit said happily.
    
    	Slim came out of the bunkhouse and smiled at the snow. Carlson followed right after. Curley walked out of his own room slumpily with a frown on his face. Crooks, the stable buck, also left his little bunk in the barn. Curley looked at him but not with the disgusted look he would give before. This upcoming Christmas would be different. Less fun, less talking, less playing, more drinking. The first and only time George had gotten drunk a couple of months ago made him realize a lot. He had never been able to do that when Lennie was under his watch or else he would have been off getting hold of another innocent animal. George stood there for a long time. Many hours may have passed, but he wasn’t keeping track.
    
    	“What’s gotten to him?” Carlson asked the other men in the room.
    
    	“Don’t know,” Whit said half heartedly, looking at the newspaper.
    
    	“You know what. Ever since Lennie’s death. Musta still be guilty. A man’s got to sometimes though,” Slim said, looking at George’s defined back.
    
    	“Oh hell he gon’ freeze out there. It’s friggin cold out. Lemme tell ya, he probably already frozen, standing there for hours,” Carlson laughed and put on his jacket.
    
    	Crooks also seemed to have seen the poor man in the cold. The snow was a few inches high and as Crooks walked to George with each step he took, his feet sunk into the snow, leaving behind him a trail of deep footprints. Wearing not too much himself, Crooks held a black scarf in his right hand as he waved to George with his left. Dressed in his usual denim trousers and coat, with no hat on, George looked up at the stable buck walking towards him. He lowered his head, and his hair shed the layer of snow that had piled up over time. Crooks yelled something, but George’s lips were too numb to even respond back. At a five feet distance from George, Crooks handed over his black scarf. George didn’t accept nor reject it. Crooks looked at him sympathetically and wrapped the wool knitted scarf around his neck. He also offered his hat, allowing the snow to hit against his own almost bald head. He said something that made George take the hat still filled with warmth and wear it so low that his eyes were barely seen. A droplet of what Crooks knew to be tear hung on George’s chin. He turned around and headed back to his own barn to look after his horses while George took his path to the bunkhouse that was battling against the tough wind.
    
    	The old swamper was the first to have any reaction when George stepped through the door. “You ‘kay?”
    
    	George took off the hat and shook off the frozen, white snow that had gathered in between the creases of his coat.
    
    	“Crap, the boss ain’t gon’ be glad if he sees that mess,” Carlson peered over at the snow.
    
    	Slim walked over and patted him on his back and headed out. It seemed as only Slim and Crooks understood, more or less, what George was feeling.
    
    	“C’mon guys, it’s Christmas month and y’all still keeping that long face? We s’posed be happy. Last year was one hell of a Christmas. Keep the spirit up man!” Whit sat up from his bed, “Forget everything for now and just enjoy alrigh’?”
    
    	“Yeah yeah,” George said his first two words. He hung his wet coat and slumped onto his bed. Unbothered by the cold, he drifted into sleep with nothing covering him. Old Candy would have asked George about their land again if he hadn’t gone to sleep so soon. As much as he knew the promise they made before has already been broken along with Lennie’s death, he still had hope in it. He believed George would forget about Lennie and eventually seek to pursue their dream land without him.
    
    	“Lennie, LENNIE!” George jerked up from his bed and looked around the dark room. Nothing and no one could be spotted in sight. He had a dream, or more precisely, a nightmare. George shut his eyes and laid back and tried to fall asleep. The second he closed his eyes he couldn’t but see what happened in the dream. Lennie was walking towards the end of a cliff. George begged him not to go one step further but Lennie disobeyed him. He walked until the tip of his toes were hanging midair. He looked at the eight hundred meters below him. He squeezed his eyes and opened them. All this while George creeped towards him. He hoped to catch Lennie before he jumped. Seeing Lennie lean forward, George made for his run. But it was too late. His hand remained clenched and hanging from the cliff.
    
    	December 25, the day came at last. A time to party and relax. A man stood in the doorway early in the morning. The sun was shining too bright for George to see his face but the big belly couldn’t be mistaken. The boss saw George was the only one up, so he stepped over the threshold and, after putting what he originally had in his hand on the floor, clapped his hands loudly. The rest of the three men opened their eyes slowly, and having seen the person in their room, sat up immediately.
    
    	“Like I said, Christmas comes but once a year. Thought I’d give it to ya early today. Give y’all a break. I know these past few months have been hard for you, little guy,” the boss turned to George, “That big friend of yours. A loss, truely a loss. He was a great worker, not gonna lie.”
    
    	“Yeah he was. Never meant any harm to anyone. A great worker he was,” George stopped right there, and coughed like he choked on a piece of meat.
    
    	The boss smiled apologetically and said, “Curley and the stable buck will be spending the day here.” Just as he turned around to leave, he stopped and met eyes with Crooks standing outside the door. For a second Crooks thought he might have smiled the slightest smile, but he paid no more attention and walked into the room where the rest of the man inhabited. Whit went straight for the gallon of whiskey the stout man left on the floor before he left.
    
    	“You guys leavin’ all this for me or what?” Whit asked. And with that, the room was filled with laughter. The gloominess that had dwelled in the bunkhouse seemed to have been kicked out by the happiness that creeped in unknowingly. Curley joined in the afternoon, and unlike the usual condescending manner he had, today he was quiet and almost polite towards everyone.
    
    	“Thanks,” Curley said to Crooks when he handed over the deck of playing cards, and Crooks froze midair for a second and tried to figure something out like the rest of the six men. When realizing there was nothing to be figured out, they laughed simultaneously. Curley looked embarrased even, “Did I say anything wrong?”
    
    	That night was different than all the nights that George had spent on the ranch. The seven men had a fun time. He drank a lot. More than everyone else, George was drunk and tired. He pointed at the leg of one of the beds and talked to it as if talking to a person.
    
    	“Why'd you leave me? Did I not tell ya to listen to me? Tol’ ya not to get in trouble but yeh jus’ did, like yeh always did. Killing the mice weren’t enough eh? Had to kill a full grown woman? What’s wrong with you? Always told people you didn’t mean no harm. You didn’t, but not when you go off breaking someone’s neck,” George stopped to swallow and take a break after shouting at the bed. “S’posed to take care o’ ya. S’posed to live off the fatta the lan' remember? The rabbits. Who’s gonna tend them if you’re not there?” he choked and wiped his entire face with the rough sleeve of his jacket. He stumbled on the flat wooden floor as he tried to make it to the bed. Candy and Carlson took this in, surprised, speechless, as they had never seen this side of George. He had always been a fairly disciplined man, a good thinker, who did everything out of rationality. George looked at the leg of the bunk. He frowned at it. The next second he swung his hand at it. The punch made a loud pang. He hit it again and again until he eventually fell onto his knees and started shaking. Fresh blood trickled down the bed but stopped before it got the chance to touch the ground. Burying his face in his palms, George let out a sound from his lips. The back of his right hand was bruised, purple, and the dried out blood left a sticky feel to it. Slim put down the bottle in his hand and walked over to George.
    
    	“Hey buddy, I know you’re not feeling great right now. Jus’ give it sometime, ya get me? I know it’s tough. Nothing has been easy on this ranch. Trust me, time heals ev’rything,” Slim said softly.
    
    	Crooks couldn’t watch it either, “He’s right. Gotta trust a man like me, who has no friends and no nothing,” he chuckled. “I knows how it feels to lose someone. Remember what I said a while back then? Lennie ain’t gon’ be happy seeing you like this. He would of been crying wit ya.”
    
    	“You knew ya had to do that man, Lennie ki—” Carlson stopped mid sentence as Curley shot him a look that could kill.
    
    	“I mean, I don't know if you still want that lan’ you talked about long time back. You promised Lennie. I could see it, his eyes shining every time you talked about it. He wanted it. Don’t give up on yourself now. Still got a long way ahead of ya, unlike an old guy like me,” Candy finished bitterly.
    
    	Whit held his bottle of whiskey that had barely anything left and strolled over the room to take a look at what he had missed out on. “What you guys doin’ here? Come drink wit me,” he raised his bottle over his head, “Whooo!”
    
    	The next morning, the men did not wake up until late afternoon, when the sun was at its highest. There were no signs of life around the bunkhouse except for the two lizards running around. The first lizard ran in front of the second one as if playing catch. The second one, much larger than the first, finally caught up to the first one, which was a lot faster, after some time. The trees stood still; their bare limbs stretched out with the two or three inches of snow that gathered over the previous night. A bird landed on one of the skinnier branches, and as it flew off again, the branch shook, and a great amount of snow came down with it.
    
    	Curley woke up to the breeze of wind that swept through his bare arms. He walked to the stove at the other side of the room and poured himself some water to rinse out the taste the whiskey left in his mouth last night. He walked over to the center table and sat down. He just remembered details from last night when he spotted a piece of paper with writings on it. Out of curiosity, he took it in his hand and read it. Half way through it, he frowned, then smiled at the paper. He woke Slim up from his sleep and without a word showed him the paper he discovered. Finishing reading the words, he swept the room with his eyes. George was nowhere to be seen. His bunk was empty as if he never came in here to get a job in the summer. The apple box that acted like a shelf was empty as well. He walked to the door and looked out at the quiet, lifeless piece of land covered in snow. A trail of footprints can be seen as they led from the bunkhouse towards the woods.
    
    	The rest of the men woke up to see Curley and Slim by the door. Going up to see what happened, they were handed that same piece of paper.
    
   *For the past few months on this ranch I have realised a lot. I needed to get over Lennie. I new that I couldn’t keep running away from the guilt I feeled sense that day. I promised him. Many times. And the way his eyes shined every time I tell him about our dream land makes me hurt inside. I new it was impossible and I still think that. But I still got ta fight for it. I want to fulfil his last dream. In writting this letter I want to say that by the time you all read this I already left. I will be off to my next adventure where I will find peace and a better life. I will be living off the fatta the land one day hopefully soon. Thank you for the time that I have been here.
    
   *Yours truly,
