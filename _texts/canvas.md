I have an empty canvas,

Wrapped tight around my soul.

One of blemishes and scars.

Of stories untold.

Put a pen to the canvas

and watch the ink bleed through.

Lines and shapes scribbled listlessly,

To create something new.

The stories written,

Are written without thought.

But why should it matter,

When it ends up for naught?

The water will run,

the ink with it too.

And then the next morning,

the canvas will be blank.

So pick up the pen, and start again.
