My dear mother, unlike any other;

Had Hands that were once smooth, and oh, so soft like none other

Her Hands are a mere replica of the woman she is inside

And though she is burdened with limits, ever so tough with pride

Her Hands grasped me gently the minute I took my first breath

And held my tiny fingers as I took my first step

Her Hands that knead the dough and sew clothes

And are capable of so much more, oh, she hardly shows

Her Hands can hold a family upright

And brush away the tears and hug one with might

Her Hands hold the stars in position, waiting for me to reach

And praise and applaud, for nothing she didn’t teach

Her Hands push me towards my fears, ever since I was three

And mold me into everything she hopes I can be

Her Hands will forever point me to the path she knows is best

And remain with me through a lifelong quest

Her Hands are a sculpturer’s work of art

And paint the story of a woman’s sacrifice from the very start

Her Hands have now grown a blister or two

And while at a glance, they may seem weak and in need of glue,

Remember that they are still so gentle, even if rough

As for me, her two Hands are quite enough
