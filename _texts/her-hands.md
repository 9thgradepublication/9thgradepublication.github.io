* My dear mother, unlike any other;
* Had Hands that were once smooth, and oh, so soft like none other
* 
* Her Hands are a mere replica of the woman she is inside
* And though she is burdened with limits, ever so tough with pride
* 
* Her Hands grasped me gently the minute I took my first breath
* And held my tiny fingers as I took my first step
* 
* Her Hands that knead the dough and sew clothes
* And are capable of so much more, oh, she hardly shows
* 
* Her Hands can hold a family upright
* And brush away the tears and hug one with might
* 
* Her Hands hold the stars in position, waiting for me to reach
* And praise and applaud, for nothing she didn’t teach
* 
* Her Hands push me towards my fears, ever since I was three
* And mold me into everything she hopes I can be
* 
* Her Hands will forever point me to the path she knows is best
* And remain with me through a lifelong quest
* 
* Her Hands are a sculpturer’s work of art
* And paint the story of a woman’s sacrifice from the very start
* 
* Her Hands have now grown a blister or two
* And while at a glance, they may seem weak and in need of glue,
* Remember that they are still so gentle, even if rough
* As for me, her two Hands are quite enough
