	   “What would you like fixed today?” the robotic female voice asked, its tone so cheery that Tiana almost forgot why she was there. She glanced to her side - she was surrounded by nothing but white walls, illuminated by even brighter, miniscule lights that climbed the corners of the small room and scaled the ceiling. 
        
    	“What would you like fixed today?”
        
    	Tiana turned back to the mirror in front of her, and studied her face. 
        
    	Her nose was slightly crooked, due to a volleyball accident that had broken it years ago. Her eyes drooped slightly, but not enough to really bother her. Long, dark eyelashes sheathed her irises, which were a deep enough brown that you couldn’t see her pupils unless sunlight shone on them. Her cupid’s bow was slightly defined, and her lips were plump and pink like begonias. 
    	“What would you like fixed today?” 
        
    	Tiana swallowed hard and broke eye contact with her reflection. It was less about what she wanted done and what she was going to be forced to have done. After all, beauty wasn’t subjective. It was up to the Beautifiers to pick and comment on every little feature of your face when you turned 18, and to give you your ticket, detailing what surgeries you needed to have done. The practice was old, and was the basis of society, really, no matter how wrong Tiana thought it was. 
        
    	She didn’t know what would happen to her if she didn’t follow their instructions, but she didn’t want to find out. There were stories about people who rebelled. Whether or not those rumors were true, they were gruesome enough that Tiana would heed them.
        
    	Reaching into her pocket, Tiana pulled out the small piece of paper, where her surgeries were typed out. Scanning them before she read them aloud, she sighed at the words written. Everything she liked about herself - her brown, hooded eyes, her full lips, her dark skin - was ordered to be changed. 
    	“What would you like fixed today?” 
    
    	Tiana took one last look at her reflection, and read out the words on the paper. 

\+++++++++++++++++++++++

    	Cold air lulled Tiana out of her slumber, and she awoke slowly, her eyes fluttering open. It took her a moment to adjust to her surroundings, but once she did, her face began to ache so severely that she thought she might fall back asleep again due to the pain. 
        
    	“Ah, there we are. Welcome back, Tiana.” The unfamiliar voice sounded too cheerful to be human, but once Tiana was able to see the figure looming above her clearly, she was surprised to see that they, in fact, were. Their hair was tied back so tightly Tiana could see it pulling on the corners of their eyes, which were a bright, blinding blue. The doctor smiled, her lips lightly tinted with red lipstick.
        
    	“I can see your heart rate rising. It’s bound to hurt, waking up just days after such a major surgery. I’ll up the painkiller going into your bloodstream, how does that sound? I know you can’t really respond due to the bandages and all, but I hope the answer is ‘good.’” She stepped to the side and began typing something into her computer, the clicking of the keyboard the only sound in the room besides Tiana’s breathing. 
        
    	“Now, while I do this, I’ll just explain to you what’s next for you. As you know, our technologies allow us to have remarkably short healing periods for surgeries like this one. The result of this is that you’re able to look at your new face today! Before I leave, I’ll remove your bandages, so you’ll be able to do just that. You can keep those bandages off, and you’ll be able to leave the Beauty Center tomorrow afternoon, after we run some tests on you to make sure everything’s okay.” The doctor walked back toward Tiana and smiled again, this time a bit tighter than before. “If you have any additional questions, make sure you ask the nurse when he comes in to bring your lunch in an hour or so. Unfortunately, I’m on a very busy schedule, so all I have time to do is to unwrap you.”
        
    	As if on cue, Tiana felt the upper half of the bed begin to lift. Once she was sitting up straight, it stopped, and Tiana was so close to the doctor that she could see that she had overlined her lips a little bit. She found it ironic that someone who had obviously had her surgery done still had something that she didn’t like about herself. 
    	“Okay. Keep still for me.”
        
    	Tiana closed her eyes, and took a deep breath. She was prepared for the worst - for everything to be altered. She was prepared not to recognize herself. 
        
    	A memory popped into her head, as she felt the layers of bandage being removed from around her head. It had been her 10th birthday, and her Aunt Nyala had brought her to a quiet area, away from the other screaming children who were shoveling cake into their mouths.
        
    	“I thought you would like this. It’s been passed down to me from your grandmother, and her mother before her, and so on.” Nyala took a small handheld mirror from her coat pocket, and slipped it into Tiana’s outstretched hands. It had a mahogany handle, and though the glass was slightly scratched, something about it seemed enticing. 
        
    	“One day, they will change the way you look,” she continued, closing her hands around the mirror in Tiana’s little ones. “But if you memorize the gaze in your eye, then you will never forget who you are inside.” 
    	“And… open!” 
        
    	Tiana opened her eyes and stared into the mirror in front of her at someone completely different. Her skin was no longer hers, her eyes were no longer hers, nor were her lips, her jaw, her nose. She wanted to cry, but knew she couldn’t. 
        
    	“I… love it,” she whispered, fighting the lump that was growing in her throat. The doctor’s wolfish smile widened.
        
    	“It’s alright to cry, you know. Many people do, just because of how life changing this is,” she said, tossing the bandages into the trash can beside the hospital bed. Tiana raised her hand to touch her cheek, feeling the impossibly smooth skin beneath her fingertips. They had even changed her skin tone to a caramel, much lighter than the umber she had previously cherished.
        
    	“I wasn’t going to cry,” Tiana muttered, slowly lowering her head so that she wouldn’t have to look at the stranger anymore. The doctor sighed, putting her finger underneath Tiana’s chin so that she’d be looking up at her. 
        
    	“Don’t be ashamed, sweetheart. It was pretty obvious. I could see it in your eyes.”
