* **_Feeling unsatisfied_**
* With a difficult task
* Day after day comes
* With zero accomplishment, pushing off the task at hand
* Until the deadline arrives
* And everything is last-minute

* **_Feeling unsatisfied_**
* When a difficult question lies before us
* Gauging whether the correct response is truly the right answer
* How others will react
* And if the other response might be a better answer
* And when we do submit the answer that seems the least wrong
* It still has painful repercussions

* **_Feeling unsatisfied_**
* When an unforeseen obstacle appears
* You never knew it was coming
* It showed itself when it was least expected
* Pulling through so fast
* And now everything is derailed

* **_Feeling unsatisfied_**
* It doesn’t have to be this way
* You can change it
* You can control it
* You can make circumstances better for yourself

* **_Feeling unsatisfied_**
* In these uncertain times
* When we don’t know which way the future will go
* We can change ourselves
* When everything seems to be submerging
* We can hold onto our values
* When things don’t seem so cheerful
* We can be there for ourselves

* **_Feeling unsatisfied_**
* Isn’t the best feeling
* To be feeling
* But, at least it’s a feeling
* We can not feel
* And instead we can choose to say that today we’re
