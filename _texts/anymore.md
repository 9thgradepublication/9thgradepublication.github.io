* Wanting to say things,
* I miss you tonight.
* The feeling of your broad shoulders
* as you carry me on your back.
* The feeling and sound of your hollow heartbeat
* as you carry me in your arms
* when I’m fast asleep.
* The feeling of your warm hands
* in the winter,
* like holding a cup of hot chocolate while watching movies.
* One scorching hot summer day,
* we were at the beach.
* The sand sizzling under our feet,
* and the waves crashing like a thunderstorm.
* You stopped in front of a hole in the sand.
* You scooped up a little turtle stuck inside,
* which was surrounded by dozens of seagulls,
* flying like vultures overhead.
* You took the turtle over to me.
* You told me to feel it,
* with an ever so delicate touch.
* I was scared at first.
* But that smile of yours radiated to me, like heat from the sun.
* When I saw your smile,
* I wasn’t scared of anything,
* anymore.
* I remember, you took that newly-hatched turtle
* and you placed it gently on the shore.
* Hoping it would go back to its mother.
* I remember watching it swim into the waves,
* you hugged me tightly.
* I remember the feeling of the hot, golden summer sand,
* and you saying things.
