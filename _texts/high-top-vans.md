* Sophie
* She reads an entire book
* Every few days
* Together
* We read on picnic benches
* Under a tree
* Just us

* Sophie
* Curly brown hair
* Glasses
* Shorter than me
* Either Dr. Martens with the embroidered red flowers

* Or high top Vans
* Like she wore
* At her bat mitzvah

* Sophie
* 200 miles away
* I live in Brooklyn
* She lives in Brookline,
* Massachusetts

* Sophie
* I still tell her
* Everything
* Sheâ€™s the only person
* In the entire world
* That I can actually be myself around
