* Loudmouth
* Funny
* Determined
* My best friend
* It all started
* That hot summer day

* That hot summer day
* Just you, me
* And
* Everyone else
* Just playing ball

* That day, started a dynasty

* Every weekend
* Every day off
* Every snow day
* Just you and me
* Just playing some ball

* Just playing some ball
* It seems to be a loop
* Same plays
* Same outcome

* Every now and then
* Something great happens

* Every now and then
* Something devastating happens

* That one hot summer day
* It was special
* It was different
* No longer the same

* Just you and me
* playing some ball
* No longer held by destiny
