title: My Motherâ€™s Rush Hour Subway Ride TEST
author: Roberto Q.

Knowing the bus was not an option,    
she ignited her run at **Kingsbridge Rd** ,
packed like a sardine on the 4 train.   
     
She accelerated downtown  
towards dreams towards hope    
    
She flew on the express track,     
letting not one local station delay her        
  
At **59 St-Lexington Av**,  
a vacant local train loomed near her. 
But she never left her spot.  

And despite twisted tracks and dilapidated signals,
she made it to **Fulton St**
just in time to switch to the A.

>                she remained scratchless.

>                       Many of her friends gave up.
>                                 I saw them.
