    Knowing the bus was not an option,

    she ignited her run at Kingsbridge Rd ,

    packed like a sardine on the 4 train.

    

    She accelerated downtown

    towards dreams towards hope

    

    She flew on the express track,

    letting not one local station delay her

    

    At -59 St-Lexington Av-,

    a vacant local train loomed near her.

    But she never left her spot.

    

    And despite twisted tracks and dilapidated signals,

    she made it to -Fulton St-

    just in time to switch to the A.

    

         And despite vandals who tried to stop her,

               she remained scratchless.

    

                      Many of her friends gave up.

                                I saw them.

                                   Their expired motors, cracked windows, and dusty metal

                                                                                 They never got past -Euclid Av-.

    		                                                                  My mother pushed through that wall

                                                                

                                                      And despite track fires, sick passengers and power outages,

                                                                                    She arrived at -Rockaway Blvd- on time

    

                                                                                                                                  There I was,

                                                                                                                sitting on the platform.

                                                                                                     I would embark on her journey.

    

                                                                                         And despite rain, snow, sleet and hail,

                                                                        she guided me to -Howard Beach-JFK Airport-,

                                                                         so that I could have the chance to go anywhere
