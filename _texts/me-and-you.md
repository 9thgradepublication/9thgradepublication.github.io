	I knew you were going to leave me. It was inevitable. All the signs were there for the longest time though I thought they would be mended by time if I turned a blind eye. If maybe, I just stayed stupidly devoted then everything would go back to normal. But blind devotion can’t cure everything.

    Or rather, my love wasn’t enough. How truly dedicated is a person who allows their marriage to fall through right in front of their eyes and constantly feels unsatisfied?
    
    Was I simply helplessly grasping at straws every time we were together? I don’t know. I just wanted to be with you. To selfishly ask for more was foolish yet I was still left constantly unsatiated. I started to seek out the warmth of another; I was trapped in romantic fantasies of my own making with someone that wasn’t you. They haunted me in the back of my mind, constantly imploring me to give in to my temptations.
    
    Those torturing afternoons left me feeling base. Unworthy. Dirty. How dare I, a creature with an adulterous mind, plead for a response from you other than your usual cold detachment.
    
    Perhaps it was the guilt of those afternoons that led me to spend every day in your hospital ward. Perhaps it was the same guilt that made me hope, pray, and desperately want to see you again pursing your lips at me as you read a book under our veranda.
    
    But, at the end of the day, all of that was only a hope. A foolish, crazy hope that not even the best doctors could fulfill. Your health left you but your cold demeanor stubbornly persisted. Even as you laid on the hospital bed with a sallow face, you refused to give me the time of day. It was only on the day of your death that you spared me a few of your words.
    
    “I don’t want to leave you,” you said with an empty look in your eyes. “ You’re too stupid to live on your own.”
    
    Though you spoke the same heartless words with the same cutting tone, there was something mixed in that I couldn’t pinpoint. Affection. Did you know how much you shocked me with your words? Did you know that in the future, I would spend evenings gazing at the handkerchief you used that day and replay that scene in my mind countless times?
    
    Anyone could see our relationship was but a crumbling visage kept up for the sake of both of our pride. So, why? Why did the ease with which you left me sting my heart so bitterly?
    
    I knew you hated me. How could you not? It was I that requested this marriage to our parents without asking for your consent first. It was I that tore you away from your childhood darling. It was also I who sought the warmth of another in secret. If I were you, I’d hate me too. I was a sinful, repulsive man.
    
    I didn’t want to let you go after all that. I thought that time would build feelings between us. Sadly, time was an elusive mistress that only did as her whims spurred her to. And it was one of her whims for you to unceasingly hate me and for me to slowly fall out of love with you.
    
    Maybe that was why I went for her warmth so soon after your departure. The object of my adulterous mind, the apple of my eye. I sank myself into enjoying her presence, drunk on the motivation to forget you.
    
    We went on the walks to the pier that I would force you to go on with me. We enjoyed the strawberry cake I gave you from the cafe where I had confessed to you all those three thousand seven hundred and two days ago. I saw the smile on her face as she enjoyed the cake with gusto you never had.
    
    I drove her back from work every day. I bought chocolate and colorful bouquets for her every month-anniversary. I tried my best to be romantic for someone that reciprocated my feelings. _This one loves me,_ I would think as she rushed to hug me when I opened the door.
    
    I thought I was finally winning the battle. I was finally living a new life, a life where all my days weren’t plagued by the sorrow of knowing you would never love me.
    
    Yet, my faith in my belief wavered. When she smiled, I saw you smiling beside her. When she laughed, I heard your haughty laughter reverberating in my mind. Would you have ever laughed as carefree as her around me?
    
    How ruthless of a person are you, to torture me so even after death?
    
    Our walks became passionless and boring. The cafe lost its appeal; she remarked that the cake didn’t taste the same as the first time I took her there with a complicated look in her eyes. She told me that the flowers were causing her allergies to flare and that the chocolate was getting boring. Finally, one day, she stopped greeting me with hugs as I walked into our apartment.
    
    Gradually, she became disillusioned with me. I wasn’t the man she believed me to be, she told me one hazy afternoon. I responded with an understanding nod and simply said that I hadn’t loved her like I thought I did. Under the overcast sky, the same sky as the day you and I married, we split ways with bitter smiles.
    
    “You never saw me when we were together,” she said as she left me staring at her back, her hair dancing in the wind.
    
    This time, I felt nothing when she packed up her things and left our apartment. I poured myself into my work, left with nothing and no one to preoccupy me. Was that all I had thought of her? A distraction?
    
    Time went on; it passed by so fast, like a train leaving the station when you are late only by a few seconds. Days turned to weeks. Weeks to months. Months became years. Grey peppered my hair and brought with it a tired air.
    
    In the time after she had left, I unpacked your things and arranged them in the same familiar fashion you would. Do you remember your favorite embroidered pillow you got as an anniversary gift from Bertha two thousand and four hundred days ago? You were so unwilling to use it in fear that it would be ruined. The pillow is right where you left it in the left-hand corner of the closet under your jewelry box.
    
    One day, I finally couldn’t take it anymore. That day was the two thousand four hundred and fifty-third day after your departure as well as my birthday. We sang happy birthday together, your portrait and I. An onlooker would have probably laughed at the extreme irony of finally being able to celebrate my birthday with you only after you were buried six feet under.
    
    I drank myself into oblivion that day as your ghost stayed at my side, casually reading a book to pass the time. Looking up at your translucent face, I made my decision:
    
    I would bring you back.
    
    Someway, somehow, I would see your face again. I’d rather have your apathy than your eternal tranquility and silence.
    
    Even if it took all eternity to see you again, I would not rest until I did. Perhaps it was — no, it definitely was — selfish of me to want to disturb your slumber. But, like before, I would bear your hate if it meant being with you again.
    
    I would be happy as long as I had you.
