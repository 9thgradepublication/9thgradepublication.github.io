		It was a dark and stormy night on the ranch, the clouds bawling, with the nauseating smell of ozone lingering in the air. The tears of the clouds drenching the famished animals from the barn roof. These animals, punishing, and scouring the area for any source of food or water they can find.

		Deep down in this land of sorrow and sentiments was Crooks, a lonely stable-buck grieving Lennie’s death-the one person he found a friend in.

		During his grievance, isolated with his thoughts from all these years of being a stable-buck, he wondered to himself “_In all my years on this ranch, there has been nothing but sorrow and loneliness for me. No one has ever cared for me here, and when I finally found a fren’, he dun’ got hisself shot. One day they’ll do the same thing to me. Maybe....”_ He started to think about his family, the only people who he knew would care for him. He was getting old anyways and might never see his family again, “..._if they’re still back in LA, then maybe I can find them. I could be sittin’ down eatin’ dinner with ‘em this time next year, it’s... May 14. How wonderful! But could I?”_

		He pondered about this for a while and finally decided that he was going to leave the ranch and reunite with his family once again. Elated he exclaimed, “My siste's must’ve grown so big by now, and oh how father will be glad to see me again!” A tear rolled down his cheek just at the thought of this dream.

		Crooks began to plot his journey, then realized, “_How will I get there? I’m over here in Soldedad, so…”_ Crooks checks his map, _“that’s over 200 miles away from Los Angeles! I’m a cripple and even gettin’ a bus around here would be a miracle. No, this plan could never work.”_

		He decided that this would be too hard, impossible for him to accomplish by himself, and he can’t tell anyone who might help him even if he could before he gets into trouble. Crooks then has an epiphany: “_If I get my back fixed, traveling this distance will be easier, and it would be a better me to show my family. But money?... It’ll cost about..say 500 bucks? So if I maybe stay on the ranch and continue to work, and possibly take on extra work, I can get the money in 10 months or less. After a shorter than a day-long surgery, I can be on my way!”_

		After months of hard work and determination, Crooks finally raised enough money to perform surgery on his back by March 1st. Unfortunately for his dream, recovery took longer than he would’ve thought. Unfortunately for him, recovery took 6 months under hospital care before he could continue his dream. After these 6 months, Crooks was back on track to finding his family.

		He headed into town and got a bus to LA, where he then returned to his family’s home, where he last saw them. He knocked on the door.

		No answer.

		He tried again.

		No answer.

		He called out, “Hello...anybody home? It’s me, your brothe’, Dill, Dilly-Nilly you would call me. I..” he froze. He never thought of what he would say to them, tell them what was going on with him, with them. How they would react…

		He continued to knock on the door until someone finally opened it. “Hello, how may I help you?” said a kind lady.

		Dill replied, frustrated, “If you were in here all this time WHY did you leave me knockin’ on your door for 12 minutes, rammin’ on about my life? Have you no human decency, or even a heart?”

		The lady replied, “I’m so sorry sir, I was sleeping, I had no idea. I’m ill and I couldn’t hear you.”

		“Oh no I’m sorry, can you ever forgive me?” replied a sympathetic, and embarrassed Crooks.

		“Of course. Now, come in, how may I help you?”

		“No thanks, I’m kind of in a rush. Do you by any chance know anything about the Wazee family?”

		“Oh yes, they moved out a year back, that’s how I got the house. But I don’t think they could’ve moved far. They’re most likely still somewhere in town.”

		“Okay, thank you for all the help.”

		“You’re welcome. Is there anything else I can do for you?”

		“No, thank you.”

		“Okay, but if there’s anything I can do to help, just ask.” The nice lady closed the door and Dill sat on the doorstep and thought to himself, “_They only moved a year ago. They couldn’t have moved far, they’re probably somewhere nearby. I’ll have to stay in town for a while, but where?”_

		He remembered the kind woman’s words. Dill knocked on the door. The nice lady once again opened the door kindly to him. He explained his situation to her and asked if he could stay with her until he finds his family. She then responded, “Of course! Make yourself at home.”

		“Thank you very much!” Dill gratefully replied.

		From then on, Dill would go out and knock on every door asking if the Wazee family lived there, repeatedly, with no response .

		Until one day, 8 months later, his journey had come to a pause. Dill had been conscripted to fight in WW2.

		One day after training, Dill sat down to eat dinner in the food tent. Another guy, who looked like him, sat down. He asked Dill, “Where are you from?”

		Dill replied, “L.A. How ‘bout you?”

		“I’m also from L.A. What’s your name?”

		“Dill, Dill Avocados.”

		“Nice to meet you, I’m Mo, short for Mohammad.”

		“What a coincidence! My father’s name is Mohammad.” Dill laughed.

		They continued to talk and talk forever, and laughed the night away, becoming the best of friends. Both on and off the battlefield they stuck together, having each other's backs in the midst of danger.

		Eventually, 6 years later, all the soldiers who survived the war were sent back to their homes to live with their families. Mo said sympathetically, “Dill, why don’t you come over for dinner tonight, stay by us?”

		“Thanks, brothe’. I’d love that.” Dill said, trying to stay cool.

		They went home to Mo’s house, where his family was waiting for them with dinner. “Why hello there! You must be Dill, Mo mentioned you to us. I’m Anna, and this is my mother Gaby. It’s so nice to meet you!” Anna remarked while shaking Dill’s hand, for longer than usual.

		“Why girls, we’re tired and hungry. Let’s get started with dinner, shall we?” Mo alluded.

		“Oh yes! Now, I’ve prepared macaroni and cheese, spaghetti, and carrots. Eat up now!” Anna eagerly exclaimed.

		“What a coincidence! Those are two of my favorite dishes, always have been growing up and still are!” Dill claimed.

		“Wow! Boy, are we lucky then!” Mo fittingly replied.

		They ate dinner then sat down in the living room and talked. Something caught Crooks’ eye. “That picture... I know it, the people. When was it taken?” He curiously inquired.

		“Oh that. It was taken years back, when…” Mo paused. “That picture was taken back when Anna was only 4 years old. We were all still together then, us and my son, Dillon. With all the commotion all over the place with WW1, we...”

		“You lost him on the train you were trying to catch to leave town, to somewhere safer, the last train leaving the station. He fell after being pushed down by another panicked passenger and never saw him again. Yeah, I know.” Crooks tearfully replied.

		“Yeah. Exactly that. How did you know?”

		“I...I think I’m your son. I once went by the name of Dillon Munna Wazee, Munna being my dad’s name. The same story happened to me, except I was the one pushed off. I never saw my family again and I got held captive, a slave to the whites-ever since I went by the name Dill Avocados.”

		The family was aghast and listening, frozen in their previous actions. Crooks clenched his fingers tightly around the cutlery, as he continued to sob. Taking a deep breath, he continued, “They kept me as a stable-buck on a ranch in Soledad for years. I had a crooked back, so they would call me Crooks. I’ve only tried coming to LA after getting operated on my back to find my family. And I’ve finally found you after 8 years.” Crooks crying happy tears hugged his family after so many years.

		“Welcome home son. We’ve missed you very much, more than you think. Not a day has passed where I haven’t thought about you-how you’re doing, where you are, what you’re doing, who you’re with. Are you okay? How’s your back? What happened? Where have you been? Oh, I love you so much son.” His mother lovingly cried while hugging him tighter than ever.

		“Oh, brother are you okay? I’ve missed you very much, us playing together, you teasing me, calling me Anna-Wanna” Anna laughed.

		“Welcome home son, we’re glad you’re back. I love you.” Crook’s father replied.

		“I... I love you guys too. I’ve missed you, and I’ve been so lonely.” Dillon was so delighted he was speechless. He was glad he finally reunited with his family. He cared about them, and they cared about him too!

		From then on, Dillon began to live with his family, as one big happy family.
